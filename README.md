## 📖 Extended Description

The **Expense Tracker** is a practical and real-world JavaScript project designed to help users **record, manage, and monitor their expenses efficiently**. Users can enter expense details such as a title and amount, which are instantly displayed in a list along with an automatically updated total balance.

The application uses **LocalStorage** to save expense data in the browser, ensuring that all records remain intact even after refreshing or closing the page. This demonstrates effective client-side data persistence without the need for a backend.

Users can easily **edit or delete expenses**, making the app flexible and user-friendly. All updates are reflected immediately in the UI and total calculation. The project emphasizes clean code structure, logical separation of concerns, and real-time DOM updates.

This Expense Tracker is ideal for **JavaScript beginners and intermediate learners** looking to strengthen their understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, objects, and browser storage. It is also a strong **portfolio project** that showcases practical problem-solving and application logic.
